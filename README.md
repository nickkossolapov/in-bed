# in-bed

A remake of a site for a [friend](https://www.instagram.com/in__bed/). 

To add a bit of functionality to an otherwise static website, I remade it using React. This is that remake.


### Dependencies

* npm 5.6+

### Setup

First install the project.

```
npm install
```

Then start up the dev server.

```
npm run
```

### Deployment

To deploy the website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), first fork the repo to your GitHub profile. Download the repo, and modify `homepage` in `package.json` with your own GitHub username: `"homepage": "http://{username}.github.io/in-bed",`.

Then just deploy the site.

```
npm run deploy
```

## Built With
